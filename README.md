# üçî Template Burger Kenzie

My first React project, it simulates an food e-commerce and is fully responsive. I did it as one of the challenges while studying in Kenzie Academy. I used React Icons lib and SASS to customize. 

## Features
- [x] add item the cart or remove item
- [x] open cart modal and show total
